# SHOW ME THE BALLOT 
## US Ballot Discovery and Analysis 
### Ballots used in US elections are notorious for being overly complex, unhelpful, even intimidating. Each county in the US has a different ballot, making it very difficult for first-time voters to prepare adequately for the experience. 
## MVP 1: 
We want to help first-time voters from FIVE toss-up states a sample ballot corresponding to the most populous county. The content of the ballot would be provided by Ballotpedia. 
(Currently, you have to go on Ballotpedia, navigate to the sample ballot page, type your address, and click three more times (make three more choices). We want to bring a sample ballot in just one click.) 

The second part of the project would have a purpose beyond the Nov 5 election â€“ it would collect as many sample ballots and use an AI Chatbot to assess and rate the ballot design, and ultimately make recomoendations in line with ballot design in other major democracies in the world.
